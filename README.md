# The-Joint-Distance-Measure
These are files containing python codes written to evaluate the performance of the Joint Distance Measure (JDM) proposed in the article: The Joint Distance Measure: A Measure of Similarity Accounting for Spatial and Angular Distances.
Codes were written and tested on Google Colab. 
Each of the four files implements a specific example case. 
Details can be found in the paper.
